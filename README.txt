Before you open the .pro file, rename it to be
	LASTNAME_A2.pro
With your last name.  

When you open the .pro file for the first time it should set up a build directory for you.
This directory is where all the .o files and your .exe (or app bundle on Mac) will go.

Check out mainwindow.cpp

Push ctrl-O  (cmd-O on Mac) to choose an image file to open.

To allow for opening two different images, it's probably not a bad idea to 
add buttons to load the images.  

Have Fun!
